# ✿ House Price Prediction ✿
House price prediction is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and data analysis. In this analysis, we will use the Linear Regression algorithm to predict house prices based on a single variable, typically an attribute that has a strong correlation with the target variable (price). Linear Regression aims to establish a linear relationship between the input variable and the target variable.

# ✿  Summary  ✿
* The above prediction says that, if the area of the house is 3300(sqr ft) then the price of the house will be 628715.75342466(US $)

# ✿  Conclusion  ✿
The House Price Prediction analysis using Linear Regression (Single Variable) is a fundamental example of predictive modeling. While this simplified approach focuses on a single attribute, real-world scenarios involve multiple variables and more complex models. Linear Regression serves as a stepping stone to more advanced regression techniques.

As we engage in this analysis, we recognize the significance of accurate house price prediction in real estate and investment decisions. The principles of Linear Regression pave the way for more sophisticated algorithms that consider multiple variables and interactions, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy.
