# ✿ House Price Prediction ✿
House price prediction is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and data analysis. In this analysis, we will use the Linear Regression algorithm to predict house prices based on a single variable, typically an attribute that has a strong correlation with the target variable (price). Linear Regression aims to establish a linear relationship between the input variable and the target variable.

# ✿  Repository Overview  ✿
This repository is about the House Price Prediction with the help of the Linear Regression Algorithm.
   - It has a python notebook where all the coding has been done.
   - It also has the relevant datasets and files used for this analysis.

# ✿  Technologies Used  ✿
* Python
* Machine learning

# ✿  Dataset  ✿
* You can download the dataset from the above file in this repository.
* https://github.com/GayasuddinMohd/House-Price_Prediction/blob/main/homeprices.xlsx
* https://github.com/GayasuddinMohd/House-Price_Prediction/blob/main/area.xlsx

# Result 
* The above prediction says that, if the area of the house is 3300(sqr ft) then the price of the house will be 628715.75342466(US $)
