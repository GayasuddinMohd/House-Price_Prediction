# House Price Prediction 
House price prediction is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and data analysis. In this analysis, we will use the Linear Regression algorithm to predict house prices based on a single variable, typically an attribute that has a strong correlation with the target variable (price). Linear Regression aims to establish a linear relationship between the input variable and the target variable.

# Technologies Used  
* Python
* Machine learning

# Dataset  
* Download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hN0NjXKYDFh48FrJhs77Zr21qdKvGS7_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101791765069871797241&rtpof=true&sd=true).
  
# Result 
* The above prediction says that, if the area of the house is 3300(sqr ft) then the price of the house will be 628715.75342466(US $)
